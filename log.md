# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday, October 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed jQuery and set up two repositories for jQuery practice. One will be for practice problems and the other will be my first of many jQuery-based projects (more to come!). For my jQuery review, did some practice problems via w3schools.

**Thoughts**: I went in thinking I was going to have to start from scratch but after a couple of sets of problems on w3schools I'm extremely happy to find I'm not as rusty (and remember a lot more!) then I thought. 

**Link(s) to work**
1. https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp
2. Practice repo: https://github.com/salpharre/jQuery-Practice-and-Projects
3. First jQuery-based project (incomplete): https://github.com/salpharre/jquery-scroll-down-page

### Day 2: Sunday, October 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More review of jQuery with exercises from w3schools

**Thoughts**: It's coming back to me, I'm ready for some exercises from my bootcamp (for day 3).

**Link(s) to work**:
Didn't commit anything since I was using an exerternal website, https://www.w3schools.com/jquery

### Day 3: Monday, October 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a repo for a coding challenge I'm participating in via Mentor Mesh (through Mighty Networks platform), will be using jQuery to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Completed two exercises in the jquery repo dedicated repo.

**Thoughts**: I'm proud of myself. There was a feature I wanted to add and I was able to figure it out very quickly. There was a stumble in the drinklist exercise, but after looking at the solution I understood what I missed and was able to adjust quickly for the second exercise.

### Day 4: Wednesday, October 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Set up basic html with some bootstrap css and a media query for rock-paper-scissors game. 

**Thoughts**: Never used media queries before, glad they're easier then I let myself believe.

### Day 5: Thursday, October 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
1. More jquery practice, preparing for an interview tomorrow

**Thoughts**: jQuery practice was more to get my mind thinking about jquery and to review it for a interview the 16th. Didn't get to work on game today, tomorrow after the interview i will. Also, didn't quite get an hour in today.

### Day 6: Tuesday, October 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Some functionality practice

**Thoughts**: I would like to say it's the test cases that are slowing me down but it's most likely my code that's the problem. (Note to self: Don't forget to open up the console when looking at test error message, there's a lot more to this onion of a problem!)

**Link(s) to work**: FYI, I'm a night owl so expect this repo to be updated at 2am.
