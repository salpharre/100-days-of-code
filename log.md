# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday, October 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed jQuery and set up two repositories for jQuery practice. One will be for practice problems and the other will be my first of many jQuery-based projects (more to come!). For my jQuery review, did some practice problems via w3schools.

**Thoughts**: I went in thinking I was going to have to start from scratch but after a couple of sets of problems on w3schools I'm extremely happy to find I'm not as rusty (and remember a lot more!) then I thought. 

**Link(s) to work**
1. https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp
2. Practice repo: https://github.com/salpharre/jQuery-Practice-and-Projects
3. First jQuery-based project (incomplete): https://github.com/salpharre/jquery-scroll-down-page
