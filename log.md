# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday, October 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed jQuery and set up two repositories for jQuery practice. One will be for practice problems and the other will be my first of many jQuery-based projects (more to come!). For my jQuery review, did some practice problems via w3schools.

**Thoughts**: I went in thinking I was going to have to start from scratch but after a couple of sets of problems on w3schools I'm extremely happy to find I'm not as rusty (and remember a lot more!) then I thought.

2. Practice repo: https://github.com/salpharre/jQuery-Practice-and-Projects
3. First jQuery-based project (incomplete): https://github.com/salpharre/jquery-scroll-down-page

### Day 2: Sunday, October 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More review of jQuery with exercises from w3schools

**Thoughts**: It's coming back to me, I'm ready for some exercises from my bootcamp (for day 3).

**Link(s) to work**:
Didn't commit anything since I was using an exerternal website, https://www.w3schools.com/jquery

### Day 3: Monday, October 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a repo for a coding challenge I'm participating in via Mentor Mesh (through Mighty Networks platform), will be using jQuery to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Completed two exercises in the jquery repo dedicated repo.

**Thoughts**: I'm proud of myself. There was a feature I wanted to add and I was able to figure it out very quickly. There was a stumble in the drinklist exercise, but after looking at the solution I understood what I missed and was able to adjust quickly for the second exercise.

### Day 4: Wednesday, October 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Set up basic html with some bootstrap css and a media query for rock-paper-scissors game. 

**Thoughts**: Never used media queries before, glad they're easier then I let myself believe.

### Day 5: Thursday, October 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
1. More jquery practice, preparing for an interview tomorrow

**Thoughts**: jQuery practice was more to get my mind thinking about jquery and to review it for a interview the 16th. Didn't get to work on game today, tomorrow after the interview i will. Also, didn't quite get an hour in today.

### Day 6: Tuesday, October 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Some functionality practice

**Thoughts**: I would like to say it's the test cases that are slowing me down but it's most likely my code that's the problem. (Note to self: Don't forget to open up the console when looking at test error message, there's a lot more to this onion of a problem!)

**Link(s) to work**: FYI, I'm a night owl so expect this repo to be updated at 2am.

### Day 7: Wednesday, October 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through 4 - 5 8kyu Codewars problems

**Thoughts**: Doing pretty well. Nice little serotonin injection. Do a couple days worth of Codewars for a couple days and then go up a level. Next week will do Hackerrank and Leetcode. No repo commits today, encountered an algorithm worthy problem in the repo I was using yesterday, didn't really touch it since I was doing Codewars only today. That's a lie, thought about it a little bit after stopped Codewars and wrote out a little bit of code, didn't push it though.

### Day 8: Friday, October 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: ISO8601 date UTC offset research for a project, fullcalendar.io not parsing date correctly. Researched the problem and possibly how to fix it. Researched licenses for github project. 

**Thoughts**: I dreaded working with fullcalendar.io since it gave so many problems last time, but it's easier to understand and wrap my head around the second delve in. Maybe because the pressure to get it working quickly in time to turn in the project is gone OR I guess I learned a lot despite feeling like a failure the first time around. Still unsure it's really as easy as copy-n-paste-ing in license jargon into a file on our repo, going to ask my network.

### Day 9: Monday, October 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the time issue bug in Organize

**Thoughts**: Glad it was a lot simpler then I thought. But fixing that bug brought up the idea to add abbreviated timezones to the popup, so the user knows what timezone the time is for.

**Link(s) to work**:
1. no commits, not pushing until another member has finished setting up a new staging branch

### Day 10: Friday, October 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work setting up mini project to mess around with moment timezones

**Thoughts**: Busy taking care of myself and applying for jobs so only got less than an hour's work but it's better then nothing. I'm challenging myself by learning how to use react-bootstrap npm package vs the cdn that I used on past react projects, I have to learn that a bit before I can work in the logic for the form but it's something I want to learn so even though it's slow, it'll be worth it in the long run.

### Day 11: Monday, October 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the visual aspect of project

**Thoughts**: Decided that learning react-bootstrap wasn't a good choice at the moment, needed to quickly get the visual part of the app set up so could start messing around with momentjs (it's for a bigger project that is supposed to go live in a couple of months). Will come back to react-bootstrap at a later date. Finished the visual aspect today. Will set up the functionality and mess around with moment tomorrow.

### Day 12: Tuesday, October 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Skeleton functionality (all functionality except for momentjs) and reviewed and took notes of documentation. And commented out some useEffects I'll need for later and created some empty functions will need when get momentjs working.

**Thoughts**: Feeling of anticipation when typing out the form functionality, slightly scared I would get it wrong but it was as easy as I remember it.

### Day 13: Monday, November 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to logically pseudocode a code challenge where it takes in two date strings and returns an array of the months in between the two without any duplications.

**Thoughts**: Pseudocoded it so it would complete 1 out of 3 test cases/example inputs but hit a wall and stopped for the day.

**Link(s) to work**:
Made a folder in here: https://github.com/salpharre/technical-coding-practice but nothing was committed as I was writing out the psuedocode on a notebook.

### Day 14: Tuesday, December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added an if statment that would make another of the test examples to pass. Created another js file to try using momentjs to get the result I want.

**Thoughts**: After a couple hours of running my mind into circles trying to get the last example input to pass, I scrapped it. And decided to attempt it using momentjs but by that time my brain was exhausted so decided to stop for today and work on other projects.

**Link(s) to work**:
There's a bunch of notes written out on pages of a notebook (filled mostly of scribbles as one line of thought didn't work) but the compiled and most important notes and psuedocode is committed here: https://github.com/salpharre/technical-coding-practice

### Day 15: Wednesday, December 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did three hackerrank problems without help, four with a little help

**Thoughts**: They were in the easy tier but yah know, gotta take the wins

**Link(s) to work**: No commits, as they were HackerRank problems

### Day 16: Wednesday, December 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a "main" branch on Note-Taker repo, an old buggy project I'm going to fix. Presently, uses a static JSON file to save notes to but changing it to MySQL as a review exercise. Will do all changes on "main" branch and then just change the origin branch to "main" and deploy it on heroku or maybe netlify.

**Thoughts**: Going to review MySQL first using Coding with Mosh tutorial on youtube and then apply what i learned to my project.

### Day 17: Thursday, January 21, 2021

Brainstormed how to DRY up manage page on Organize. Thinking to extrapolate out functions that are prepetitive and put into a seperate file that is then imported into the page where values are passed to it. Current lines of code of mammoth manage page: 689 and that doesn't include the html/jsx which if included comes to a whopping 936 pieces of code.

Nothing to show for it, just was typing up brainstorming. 

### Day 18: Tuesday, January 26, 2021

Completed three algorithm questions out of https://github.com/salpharre/technical-coding-practice , hadn't feeling myself since the weekend so despite it being frustrating, I completed three questions and felt a little better after the high.

Commits can be found here: https://github.com/salpharre/technical-coding-practice

### Day 19: Thursday, January 28, 2021

After that embarassing html and css test question on a tech assessment I took on the 27th, will be reviewing html and css and learning CSS Grid while also doing the JavaScript30 challenge/class. (I will learn how to make four boxes inside of each other!). Also another embarassing thing is I misread a question: "what do you do if you run out of time on a technical problem?" and I thought it mean a tech assessment and so I was like "oh um, just write what I would have done in the readme" but really this was referring to a technical problem at work and I'M JUST LAUGHING AT MYSELF PFFT HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Oh man. That assessment was just so sad. xD

Today, I did a speed review on w3schools and then started the CSS Grid class by downloading firefox for developers, copy and pasting in the first exercise into my own practice repo and [watched/followed along to the first video (did I do this today? delete this bracket msg if didn't]
